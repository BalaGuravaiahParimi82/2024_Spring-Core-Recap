2. Factory Design Pattern Using Java.
3. Constructor Injection Using Java.

5. Composition vs Aggregation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Composition : 

If Student Class destroys then we need to destroy teacher object as well at the same time then we call it as Composition.
Simply Student object containing Teacher Object.
Simple in Student Object we have Teacher object.
Without Student Object Teacher Object doesn't exists.
simply Object Created Inside Object
Example of Tight Coupling

Aggregation : 

If Student Object Destroys then Teacher Object won't destroy.
Teacher object can be used by some other classes as well
It was not attached to Student anymore
Example of Loose Coupling
